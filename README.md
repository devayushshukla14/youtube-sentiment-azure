# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

An end-to-end real-time NLP pipeline that captures live YouTube comments, analyzes sentiment using Hugging Face Transformers and rule-based logic, and stores the processed data on Azure Blob Storage for further analysis via CSV or Tableau dashboards.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Python** (YouTube API client, Sentiment Analysis, Event Hub producer)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`)
- **Azure Event Hub** (Real-time event ingestion)
- **Azure Stream Analytics** (Stream processing with SQL-like queries)
- **Azure Blob Storage** (Output sink for processed comment data)
- **Rule-Based Classifier** (Basic logic on keywords)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **YouTube Comment Fetcher (Python Script)**  
   - Connects to the YouTube Data API to fetch the latest comments from a given video (`
Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning | Official Trailer (2025 Movie)`).
   - For each comment:
     - Performs **sentiment analysis** using a **Hugging Face transformer model** (`hf_sentiment`).
     - Also applies a **rule-based sentiment classifier** (`rule_sentiment`).
   - Sends the enriched comment data as JSON messages to **Azure Event Hub**.

2. **Azure Event Hub**  
   - Acts as a **real-time event streaming platform**.
   - Receives the incoming comment events and holds them briefly for processing.

3. **Azure Stream Analytics**  
   - Subscribes to Event Hub as an input source.
   - Uses a SQL-like query to project and clean the data.
   - Writes the processed output to **Azure Blob Storage** in real time.

4. **Azure Blob Storage**  
   - Stores the results as **JSON files**, partitioned by date and time.
   - Files are named and structured by timestamp for easy retrieval.

5. **CSV Conversion & Tableau Visualization**  
   - JSON output is downloaded and converted to a **CSV file** manually or via script.
